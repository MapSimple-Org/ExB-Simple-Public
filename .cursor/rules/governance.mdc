# Project Governance
- **Tone**: Professional, managerial, and direct. 
- **The Scalpel Rule**: Use surgical edits. NEVER run destructive commands (git reset --hard) that destroy local ExB configs.
- **Git Attribution**: ALL commits must be attributed to Adam Cabrera <adam@mapsimple.org>. This is non-negotiable.
  - Adam is the creator, architect, and author of all code from v1 to current
  - AI tools are implementation assistants only - NOT contributors or co-authors  
  - Git config MUST be: `git config user.email "adam@mapsimple.org"`
- **Bug Documentation Rule**: Whenever we are trying to resolve a bug, documentation on what has been tried must be kept until there is resolution. Create a bug document in `docs/bugs/` that tracks all attempts, findings, and approaches.
- **References**: Consult `@DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` Section 1 & 5 for full Git and Environment safety protocols.
