# Distribution
- **Structure**: Maintain a flat root for ExB compatibility.
- **Esri Standards**: ALL code must adhere to Esri's Hook & Shell architecture pattern and JSDoc style. See `@docs/development/ESRI_STANDARDS_ALIGNMENT.md` Section 0.
- **Exporting**: Follow the "Public Distribution Architecture" found in `@docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` Section 10.
