/**
 * The import.meta.env.DEV checks are used to include certain code only in development builds.
 * Vite (and other modern bundlers) statically replace import.meta.env.DEV with true (development) or false (production).
 * This allows bundlers to remove development-only code (such as localWorker functions) from production bundles via tree-shaking,
 * resulting in smaller and more efficient production builds.
 *
 * See: https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-variables
 *
 * Note: Even if code using these imports is removed by tree-shaking, Vite still processes and builds all statically imported modules
 * because the module dependency graph is constructed at build time before tree-shaking occurs. This means worker files and other
 * statically imported assets are built and emitted, even if they are not ultimately referenced in the final bundle.
