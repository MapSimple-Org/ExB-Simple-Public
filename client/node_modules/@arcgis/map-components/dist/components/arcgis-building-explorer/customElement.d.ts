 * The Building Explorer component is used to filter and explore the various components of [BuildingSceneLayers](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-BuildingSceneLayer.html). BuildingSceneLayers are complex digital models of buildings and interiors and can contain thousands of components grouped in sublayers. Using this component, buildings can be filtered by level, construction phase or by disciplines and categories.
 *
 * **Known limitations**
 *
 * Building Explorer is only supported in a 3D [Scene](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/) component.

However, if you are migrating a large application from widgets to components, you might prefer a more gradual transition. To support this use case, the SDK includes this `view` property which connects a component to a MapView or SceneView. Ultimately, once migration is complete, the Building Explorer component will be associated with a map or scene component rather than using the `view` property.
