/**
 * ## Overview
 * The Popup component allows users to view content from feature attributes. Popups enhance web applications
 * by providing users with a simple way to interact with and view attributes in a layer.
 * They play an important role in relaying information to the user, which improves the storytelling capabilities of the application.
 *
 * The [arcgis-map](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-map/), [arcgis-scene](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/), and [arcgis-link-chart](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-link-chart/) components currently use the [Popup widget](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-widgets-Popup.html) by default.
 * To use the Popup component, add it to the [arcgis-map.popup](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-map/#popup), [arcgis-scene.popup](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/#popup), or [arcgis-link-chart.popup](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-link-chart/#popup) component using the `popup` slot.
 * The Popup component will be opened automatically to display the selected feature's popup template when features in the Map, Scene, or Link Chart are clicked.
 *
 * ```html
 * <arcgis-map id="06ca49d0ddb447e7817cfc343ca30df9">
 *   <!-- Add the popup component to the popup slot. -->
 *   <arcgis-popup slot="popup"></arcgis-popup>
 * </arcgis-map>
 * ```
 * The Popup component can also be opened manually at a specific location with custom content specified in the method parameters using the `open()` method.
 * To prevent the popup from opening automatically when clicking on features within view components, set the `popup-disabled` attribute to `true`.
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- Set popup-disabled attribute -->
 * <arcgis-map id="06ca49d0ddb447e7817cfc343ca30df9" popup-disabled>
 *   <!-- Add the popup component to the popup slot. -->
 *   <arcgis-popup slot="popup"></arcgis-popup>
 * </arcgis-map>
 * <script>
 * const viewElement = document.querySelector("arcgis-map");
 * const popupComponent = document.querySelector("arcgis-popup");
 * // Listen for clicks on the view and open the popup at the clicked location with custom content.
 * viewElement.addEventListener("arcgisViewClick", (event) => {
 *   const { mapPoint } = event.detail;
 *   popupComponent.open({
 *     location: mapPoint,
 *     heading: "You clicked here",
 *     content: "Latitude: " + mapPoint.latitude.toFixed(3) + ", Longitude: " + mapPoint.longitude.toFixed(3)
 *   });
 * });
 * </script>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Popup UI
 * The [arcgis-map](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-map/), [arcgis-scene](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/), or [arcgis-link-chart](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-link-chart/) components contain a default popup.
 * This popup can display generic content, which is set in its [heading](#heading)
 * and [content](#content) properties.
 * When  content is set directly on the Popup instance it is not tied to a specific feature or layer.
 *
 * ![popup-basic-example](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/assets/img/apiref/widgets/popup/popup-basic.png)
 *
 * In the image above, the text "Marriage in Nassau County Census Tract 5177.01" is the popup's [heading](#heading).
 * The remaining text is the popup's [content](#content).
 * A dock button is displayed in the top right corner of the popup allowing the user to dock the popup to one of the sides or corners of the view.
 * The options for docking may be set in the [dockOptions](#dockOptions) property.
 * The popup may also be collapsed by clicking the collapse button (the down arrow icon) in the top right corner of the popup.
 * When collapsed, only the heading of the popup displays.
 * The popup may be closed by clicking the close button (the "x" icon) in the top right corner of the popup.
 *
 * Popups can also contain [actions](#actions) which execute a function defined by the developer when clicked.
 * By default, every popup has a "Zoom to" action (as shown in the image above with the magnifying glass) that allows users to zoom to the selected feature.
 * See the [actions](#actions) property for information about adding custom actions to a popup.
 *
 * The Popup component is tied to a [arcgis-map](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-map/), [arcgis-scene](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/), or [arcgis-link-chart](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-link-chart/) component, whether it's docked or anchored to the selected feature.
 * If wanting to utilize the Popup functionality outside of [arcgis-map](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-map/), [arcgis-scene](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/), or [arcgis-link-chart](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-link-chart/), the [arcgis-features](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-features/) component can be used to display the same content
 * in its own container.
 *
 * ## Popup and PopupTemplate
 * [PopupTemplates](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-PopupTemplate.html) are closely related to Popup, but are more specific to [layers](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-Layer.html)
 * and [graphics](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-Graphic.html). Popup templates allow you to define custom titles and content templates based on the source of the
 * [selected feature](#selectedFeature). When a layer or a graphic has a defined
 * popup template, the popup will display the content defined in the popup template when the feature is clicked.
 * The content may contain field values from the attributes of the [selected feature](#selectedFeature).
 *
 * Custom PopupTemplates may also be assigned directly to a popup by setting [graphics](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-Graphic.html) on the
 * [features](#features) property.
 *
