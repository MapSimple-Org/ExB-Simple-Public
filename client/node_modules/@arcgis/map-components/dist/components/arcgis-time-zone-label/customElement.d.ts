 * Time Zone Label is a component for displaying the current [time zone](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-map/#timeZone) of a [Map](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-map/).
 * The component has two states, collapsed as a small button and expanded displaying the internationalized name of the Map's time zone.
 * Users can toggle between these states by clicking the component's expand/collapse button.
 * By default the component is collapsed.
 *
 * When expanding, the component will lengthen inwards when [positioned](#position) within a Map.
 * This behavior can be overridden by setting the [expandDirection](#expandDirection) property to either `"start"` or `"end"`.
