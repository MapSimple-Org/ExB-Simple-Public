 * The Scale Bar component displays a scale bar representing the scale of the map.
 * It respects various coordinate systems and displays units in metric or imperial values.
 * Metric values show either kilometers, meters, centimeters, or millimeters depending on the scale, and likewise, imperial values show miles, feet, or inches depending on the scale.
 * When working with Web Mercator or geographic coordinate systems the scale bar takes into account projection distortion and dynamically adjusts the scale bar.
 *
 * When the scale bar is inside the map, the actual location of the scale bar is used to calculate the scale.
 * Otherwise, the center of the map is used to calculate the scale.
 *
 * **Known limitations**
 *
 * - This component is not currently supported within a Scene component.

To support this use case, the SDK includes this `view` property which connects a component to a MapView or SceneView. Ultimately, once migration is complete, the Scale Bar component will be associated with a map or scene component rather than using the `view` property.
