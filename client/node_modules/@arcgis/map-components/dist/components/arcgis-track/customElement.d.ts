 * The Track component is a button that when activated continuously animates the Map or Scene

 * The view rotates based on device heading, and the default heading symbol will display
 * when speed is greater than zero and the browser provides heading information.
 *
 * This component uses the browser's [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) which is only available in [secure contexts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts), such as HTTPS.
 * Note that localhost is considered "potentially secure" and can be used for easy testing in browsers that support
 * [Window.isSecureContext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/isSecureContext#browser_compatibility).
 *
 * **Known limitations**
 *
 * - The heading symbol is not currently supported within a [Scene component](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/).

To support this use case, the SDK includes this `view` property which connects a component to a MapView or SceneView. Ultimately, once migration is complete, the Track component will be associated with a map or scene component rather than using the `view` property.
