However, if you are migrating a large application from widgets to components, you might prefer a more gradual transition. To support this use case, the SDK includes this `view` property which connects a component to a MapView or SceneView. Ultimately, once migration is complete, the Basemap Gallery component will be associated with a map or scene component rather than using the `view` property.
