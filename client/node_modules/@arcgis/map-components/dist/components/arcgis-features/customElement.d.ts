/**
 * The Features component allows users to view a feature's popupTemplate content such as attributes,
 * actions, related records, etc., without having to be tied to a [arcgis-map](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-map/) or [arcgis-scene](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/) component.
 * This component looks and behaves similarly to the [arcgis-popup](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-popup/) component,
 * however unlike Popup, the Features component can be placed outside of the map or scene component.
 * For example, when features are selected in the [arcgis-map](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-map/),
 * the [arcgis-popup](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-popup/) opens within the map whether it is docked
 * or anchored to the selected feature.
 * With the Features component, the same information that Popup provides is shown in a separate container from the map, such as
 * a HTML div within a Calcite Design System
 * [Shell Panel](https://developers.arcgis.com/calcite-design-system/components/shell-panel/).
 *
 * If multiple features are passed into the Features component, the component provides buttons to page though the features and a feature menu that allows the
 * list of features to be displayed so the user can choose which feature content to display in the component. The component also respects
 * feature reduction PopupTemplates for [binning](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-support-FeatureReductionBinning.html#popupTemplate) and [clustering](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-support-FeatureReductionCluster.html#popupTemplate).
 *
 * The Features component should be used if needing to use the Popup functionality outside of the map or scene component. If wanting to show a single feature's content without
 * actions, related records, clustering configuration, etc., then use the [arcgis-feature](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-feature/) component.

     * in the [view](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-View.html). In order to use this, a layer must already have an
     * associated [PopupTemplate](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-PopupTemplate.html). This method allows a developer to
     * control how the input location is handled.
     *
     * @example
     * ```js
     * // Use reactiveUtils to watch the map's click event.
     * reactiveUtils.on(() => map, "arcgisViewClick",
     * (event) => {
     *   // Call fetchFeatures and pass in the click event screenPoint
     *   featuresComponent.fetchFeatures(event.screenPoint).then((response) => {
     *     // Access the response from fetchFeatures
     *     response.allGraphicsPromise.then((graphics) => {
     *     // If there are no graphics in the click event, then make sure
     *     // the Features component is not showing.
     *       if(graphics.length === 0){
