/**
 * The Daylight component can be used to manipulate the lighting conditions of a
 * [Scene](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/).
 * To achieve this, the component modifies the `lighting` property of the
 * [environment](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/#environment) of the Scene component.
 *
 * To illuminate the scene, one can either use a configuration of date and time to position the
 * [sun](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-3d-environment-SunLighting.html) or switch to the
 * [virtual](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-3d-environment-VirtualLighting.html) mode,
 * where the light source is relative to the camera.
 *
 * When illuminating the scene with **[sunlight](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-3d-environment-SunLighting.html)**
 * and adjusting the time and date, the positions of the sun and stars are updated accordingly. This also updates the
 * [date](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-3d-environment-SunLighting.html#date) property of
 * [environment.lighting](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/#environment).
 *
 * [![daylight-default](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/assets/img/apiref/components/daylight/daylight-default.png)](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/daylight/)
 *
 * The component has an option to select the timezone. When the user makes any adjustments here, a new time
 * in the chosen timezone is calculated and displayed in the slider. The timezone selector can be disabled
 * by using the [hideTimezone](#hideTimezone) property.
 *
 * By default, a calendar is displayed to select the day, month, and year.
 * With the [dateOrSeason](#dateOrSeason) property, the calendar can be replaced with
 * a dropdown menu where a season can be selected instead:
 *
 * ![daylight-seasons](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/assets/img/apiref/components/daylight/daylight-seasons.png)
 *
 * There are two play buttons: one corresponds to the time-of-day slider and animates the lighting
 * over the course of a day, while the other corresponds to the date picker
 * and animates the lighting over the course of a year (month by month). The speed of the animation can
 * be set using the [playSpeedMultiplier](#playSpeedMultiplier) property.
 *
 * ![daylight-animation](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/assets/img/apiref/components/daylight/daylight-animation.gif)
 *
 * Except for the daytime slider, all the elements in the Daylight component can be hidden:
 *
 * ![daylight-no-elements](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/assets/img/apiref/components/daylight/daylight-no-elements.png)
 *
 * Whenever the sun position option is unchecked, the scene applies the
 * **[virtual light](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-3d-environment-VirtualLighting.html)** source relative to the camera.
 * With this, the component's time slider, timezone, and date picker get automatically disabled:
 *
 * ![daylight-virtual](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/assets/img/apiref/components/daylight/daylight-virtual.png)
 *
 * **Things to consider**
 *
 * * Daylight is only supported in a 3D [Scene](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/) component.
 * * The Daylight component uses UTC time and does not account for the daylight savings times in different countries and regions of the world.
 * * When using the [virtual light](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-3d-environment-VirtualLighting.html),
 * setting the time and date programmatically does not have an influence on the lighting conditions of the scene.
 * * When using the [sunlight](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-3d-environment-SunLighting.html),
 * the time slider and time zone automatically react to the changes of the camera (e.g., position, rotation, pan, zoom) because the position of the simulated sun
 * is updated to maintain a consistent solar time of day based on the camera's current longitude. This can be adjusted using the
 * [cameraTrackingEnabled](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-views-3d-environment-SunLighting.html#cameraTrackingEnabled)
 * property on [environment.lighting](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/references/map-components/arcgis-scene/#environment).
