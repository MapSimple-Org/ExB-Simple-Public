# Project Governance
- **Tone**: Professional, managerial, and direct. 
- **The Scalpel Rule**: Use surgical edits. NEVER run destructive commands (git reset --hard) that destroy local ExB configs.
- **References**: Consult `@DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` Section 1 & 5 for full Git and Environment safety protocols.
